# Portfolio 2021 â€“ Front-end Developer

## Introduction

This project is mainly made with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), and it was initialized with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can clone this repository and create your own portfolio based on mine.

## Starting with this project

Once cloned, all you need to do is start the App with `npm start` while you're in the project folder. A new browser tab/window will be opened in the *localhost* with the port 3000. If not, just open in your browser [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

I hope you enjoy this project. See you coding!

**PD:** This project was started without React (only with Vanilla JavaScript), so as you can see in the first commits I was adapting the project to it. By the way, thanks for seeing this portfolio! I hope you like it.
